I needed to practice making API calls in ReactJS and also wanted to experiment a bit with [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/). I used [this tarot api](https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api), modified slightly so I could serve it on Heroku alongside the app.

I love tarot and witchiness in general! So I built an app to draw a random tarot card and display a bit of information about its meaning.
