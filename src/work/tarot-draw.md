I needed to practice making API calls in ReactJS and also wanted to experiment a bit with [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/). Combined this experiment with my love for tarot and general witchiness, and built an app to draw a random tarot card and display a bit of information about its meaning.

I used an API built by user [ekelen on github](https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api), modified slightly so the server could serve up this app at the same time.
