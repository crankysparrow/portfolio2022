Built a custom WordPress theme for this creative agency in Manayunk, Philadelphia. I used Advanced Custom Fields to create modules that can be customized and rearranged across several different website templates.

The site is unfortunately no longer live, but you can see [more screenshots here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/86935413/Muhlenhaupt-Company-website).
