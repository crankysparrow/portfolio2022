A second set of generative art experiments, these from 2022. Most of these are still making use of p5.js, though by this point I was playing more with the native Canvas API as well as libraries like ThreeJS as well. This was also around the time I started really liking TypeScript; the code is a mix of JS & TS. The items featured at the page linked below are a few of my favorites out of the year. There are a few flow fields, some looping patterns, and a mandelbrot set, among others.
