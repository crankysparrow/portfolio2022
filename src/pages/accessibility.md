I'm committed to making this website as accessible as possible. 

I am following [WCAG 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) guidelines. When I'm working on the site, I test with keyboard and screen readers. I also periodically go back to check existing pages to catch things I might have missed. 

However! I am a human and I'm sure I've still missed something. If you encounter any difficulty accessing anything on this site, please let me know! You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-enos/) or open an issue in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/crankysparrow/portfolio2022).
