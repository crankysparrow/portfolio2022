* [pink, soft, glittering developers](https://maggieappleton.com/glitter-devs) - note in maggie appleton's digital garden on __femme dev__, which she uses to refer to the trend of pastel-shaded, cute, intentionally feminine-styled developer things. In a field hugely dominated by men-identifying people, I'm into this.
    * also [computecuter.com](https://computecuter.com/), which i found via the above page
* i am re-learning react recently and discovered [react-spring](https://react-spring.dev/) - this is an approach to animation i want to learn more about
    * [an amazingly fun react-spring example](https://o48nx3n19z.csb.app/) 
* I've been poking about the concept of __digital gardening__ lately. A few garden-type things I am inspired by:
    * [joel hooks](https://joelhooks.com/)
    * [are.na](https://www.are.na/) - I haven't signed up for this just because I am 90% sure it'll result in an hours-long rabbit hole (but maybe that's the point?)
    * [brad woods digital garden](https://garden.bradwoods.io/) very cool concept for mostly dev topics. I love this one. Beautiful, simple illustrations.
    * [tom critchlow wiki](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) organizing thoughts into wiki-type folders.
