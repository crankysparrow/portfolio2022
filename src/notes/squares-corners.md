I was going through some generative art experiments from earlier this year, and found a bunch that are all riffing off this same concept of animating points on a square plus-sign shape.

basic pattern goes like this...

{% include './views/partials/frame.njk' frame: "/sketches/pattern", size: "wide" %}

simple example of it in motion:

{% include './views/partials/frame.njk' frame: "/sketches/basic-cross", size: "sm" %}
